# Privacy

c4hero is a **local-first** application. This document describes exactly what
data the app handles, where it lives, and what is sent over the network.

## Workspaces and diagrams

- All workspace data — your model elements, relationships, views, tags, styles,
  groups, and node positions — is stored on your device.
- When you save to a `.dsl` file (or to a folder of `.dsl` files), the data is
  written to your filesystem via the browser's native file APIs.
- For crash recovery, c4hero also keeps a copy of your active workspace in
  your browser's `localStorage`. This data never leaves your device.
- Nothing is uploaded to a c4hero server. There is no c4hero server in the
  data path. The browser app is a static bundle.

## File system access

- Single-file editing (`.dsl`) works in every modern browser.
- Folder-based collections rely on the
  [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API),
  which is currently only available in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge,
  Brave, Arc, Opera). Granted folder/file handles are stored in
  `IndexedDB` so c4hero can re-open them on reload; revoking permission in your
  browser revokes c4hero's access immediately.

## Logging and hosted observability

- The app emits structured logs in the browser console for diagnostics.
- Hosted observability is **disabled by default** in the open source build.
  Self-hosted builds only send data to third-party observability services if
  the operator sets the related `VITE_*` variables at build time.
- The hosted app at [app.c4hero.com](https://app.c4hero.com) may use
  Cloudflare Web Analytics for aggregate page counts and Web Vitals on
  non-editor routes. The in-app beacon is not loaded on `/collection/*`, and
  Cloudflare SPA route tracking is disabled so collection, workspace, and view
  slugs are not sent through the Web Analytics beacon.
- The hosted app may use Sentry for client-side error reports. The integration
  is configured with every default data-collection category switched off, no session replay, no performance
  tracing, and route scrubbing that replaces collection/workspace/view slugs
  with placeholders before an error report is sent.
- Cloudflare analytics and Sentry initialization both respect Global Privacy
  Control, Do Not Track, and a local opt-out flag at
  `localStorage["c4hero:observability:disabled"] = "true"`.
- If a hosted deployment is proxied through Cloudflare or uses Cloudflare
  dashboard auto-injection, the operator must keep Web Analytics disabled or
  excluded for `/collection/*` so editor route paths are not collected outside
  the app's beacon guard.
- The optional `VITE_LOG_ENDPOINT` build-time variable can be set by an
  operator to forward `warn`/`error` log entries to an HTTPS endpoint via
  `navigator.sendBeacon`. This is **disabled by default** in this open source
  build. If you set it for a hosted deployment, also add the endpoint origin
  to your CSP `connect-src` policy and document the destination for your
  users.

## AI features (bring-your-own-key)

- The optional AI assistant is **opt-in** and **bring-your-own-key (BYOK)**. It
  is inert until you enter your own API key in AI settings. You choose the
  provider — currently **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, or **Google Gemini**.
- Your API key(s) are stored only in this browser's `localStorage` (key
  `c4hero.ai.json`) and are never sent to any c4hero server — there isn't one.
- When you run an AI feature, requests go **directly from your browser to your
  chosen provider** (`api.anthropic.com`, `api.openai.com`, or `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`).
  The contents of those requests include the parts of your model needed for the
  feature (for example, your prompt plus a text summary of elements and
  relationships for Review, Edit, Auto-describe, and ADR drafting). Review your
  provider's privacy terms to understand how they handle that data.
- If you use repo scanning, c4hero reads the selected folder in your browser,
  redacts secret-looking values from key manifest/config excerpts, then sends
  the file tree plus those redacted excerpts to your chosen AI provider.
- No AI request is made unless you explicitly trigger a feature. Disabling AI in
  settings hides the assistant; clearing site data removes the stored key.
- **Voice-to-text** dictation (the mic button on AI text boxes) uses your
  browser's built-in Web Speech API. The audio is handled by the browser, not by
  c4hero — and in some browsers (e.g. Chrome) the browser sends that audio to the
  browser vendor's speech-recognition service for transcription. This only
  happens while you are actively dictating, and the recognized text stays in the
  text box until you choose to run an AI feature with it. If you prefer not to
  use it, simply type instead; the button does nothing unless you press it.
- Anyone with access to this browser profile can read the stored key, the same
  as any other site credential kept in `localStorage`. Use a scoped key.

## Cookies

c4hero does not set cookies.

## What's stored, where

| Data | Location | Cleared by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active workspace (crash recovery) | `localStorage` | Clearing site data; loading a different workspace |
| Recent file/folder handles | `IndexedDB` | Clearing site data; revoking handle in the browser |
| Settings (theme, panel state) | `localStorage` | Clearing site data |
| AI settings + API key (BYOK) | `localStorage` (`c4hero.ai.json`) | Clearing site data; clearing the key in AI settings |
| Workspace files (`.dsl`, `.c4hero.json` sidecar) | Filesystem (your machine) | Deleting the files |

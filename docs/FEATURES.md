# Features

A more detailed reference for what c4hero ships. The README is the elevator pitch; this is the full menu.

## C4 modelling

- Visual editing for **people, software systems, containers, and components** — the full C4 element vocabulary. **Deployment nodes, infrastructure nodes, and container / software-system instances** render on the canvas, round-trip through the DSL, and are authored visually from the add panel on a deployment view: nest nodes, place instances and infrastructure, rename inline, and delete with the subtree cascading.
- All six view types: **system landscape, system context, container, component, dynamic, and deployment**.
- **Dynamic views** render an ordered interaction sequence — each step carries its numbered badge and an optional per-step description on the edge. Steps are edited visually from the add panel: add (including response steps travelling back over an existing relationship), reorder, describe, and delete, with the sequence renumbering automatically.
- **Deployment views** render the deployment environment as nested deployment-node boundaries wrapping the container / system instances and infrastructure nodes that run inside them.
- Drill-through navigation between views (zoom into a system → its containers; zoom into a container → its components). View history with back navigation.
- **Boundaries are first-class.** Container and component views auto-render the parent system / container as a labelled boundary around its members; deployment views nest one boundary per deployment node.
- **Groups** for ad-hoc clustering across element types.

## Structurizr DSL

- Parses and serializes the [Structurizr DSL](https://docs.structurizr.com/dsl/language) — the same format used by Structurizr Lite, Studio, and the Java/JSON exporters.
- Round-trips: `parse(serialize(workspace)) === workspace` for everything c4hero models. Substantial round-trip test coverage protects this contract.
- Supports element styles, relationship styles, tags (with cascade), `properties { … }` blocks, owners, technology, status, custom URLs, and `!docs` / `!adrs` references.
- **Preprocessor directives survive.** `!include`, `!const`, `!var`, `!docs`, `!adrs` and any other `!` line are kept verbatim in their block (or element) and re-emitted on save.
- **Multi-file workspaces.** When a folder is open, `!include <relative path>` is resolved (recursively, relative to the including file) and the stitched model is rendered. Declarations remember their file; the inspector shows *Defined in …*. Saves are routed: the root keeps its own content plus the include lines, and plain model fragments included from inside `model { }` are written back to their own file. Files c4hero can't route back yet are shown read-only. Cycles, missing files and oversized graphs are reported, never hung. URLs, absolute paths and `..` escapes are left unresolved. Single-file opens (no folder handle) don't resolve includes; the code pane flags them.
- Sidecar JSON file (`<workspace>.c4hero.json`) holds non-DSL metadata — node positions, view auto-layout direction, viewport state — so layout survives DSL edits.

## File workflows

- **Import C4-PlantUML and Mermaid C4.** Paste or drop a `.puml` file or a Mermaid `C4Context` / `C4Container` / `C4Component` block; the dialog auto-detects the format, previews the counts, lists every skipped line with its number, and loads an editable canvas that saves as Structurizr DSL. Boundaries become nesting or groups; `_Ext` / `Db` / `Queue` variants map to location, tags and shapes. Styling macros, sprites, deployment nodes and dynamic steps are reported and skipped.
- **Folder collections** (Chromium browsers): open a folder of `.dsl` files, pick a workspace, and edit. Saves write back to disk via the File System Access API.
- **Single-file mode** (all browsers): open a `.dsl` file directly. Saves either go back to the source handle (where supported) or trigger a download.
- **Recent collections / files** are remembered in `localStorage` and re-openable from the welcome screen.
- **Crash recovery**: the active workspace is mirrored to `localStorage`. If the tab crashes or you close it mid-edit, the next launch offers to restore.
- **Watch mode**: the open `.dsl` (and its sidecar) is polled while the tab is visible and reloaded when it changes outside c4hero — an external editor, a `git checkout`. Active view, viewport, and selection are kept. If you have unsaved local edits, a conflict bar offers *Reload* or *Keep mine* instead of picking for you; unparseable text is reported and not applied; a deleted file leaves your model in place. c4hero's own saves are recognised and never trigger a reload. Toggle via the *Watch Mode* command (default on when a file or folder is linked).

## Editing UX

- **Inspector** (right panel) for element and relationship properties: name, description, technology, owner (with autocomplete from existing teams), URL, status, tags. Status offers the four built-in lifecycle values (`Live`, `Planned`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`) plus any extras declared under **Custom statuses** in canvas settings and any the open workspace already uses — c4hero's status axis is its own (neither C4 nor Structurizr has a lifecycle concept), so the vocabulary is not closed.
- **Add Element panel** (left): quick-create new elements or pull existing-but-out-of-view elements onto the canvas. Auto-wires relationships from the model on add.
- **Multi-select** mode (M) for batch operations: group, delete, duplicate.
- **Removal impact** — before you delete anything, see exactly what goes with it:
  the children rolled up, every relationship that loses an endpoint, the elements
  that pointed at it (and what pointed at those, a few hops out), the elements
  left with nothing attached, and the views that disappear because their scope
  element did. Deterministic — counted off the model, never estimated. Open it
  from the inspector or the command palette, select the blast radius on the
  canvas, then delete through the usual confirmation.
- **Highlighter panel** (H): tag, status, technology, and team filters that stack across facets to highlight matching subgraphs without hiding the rest of the diagram. Each facet has Any-of / All-of mode.
- **Search** (⌘F): jump to any element across views.
- **Command palette** (⌘K): every action is reachable from here, with shortcuts shown alongside.

## Layout

- **Auto-arrange** with dagre, with selectable direction (TB / BT / LR / RL).
- **Snap to 32px grid** so manually-placed nodes land on visible dots.
- **Smart edge routing**: handle slot picker spreads multiple edges across a node's side (a/b/c slots) so they don't overlap.
- **Zoom-to-fit** that respects the floating chrome, so the diagram is centred in the visible canvas, not under the panels.

## Documentation and decisions

- **`!docs` and `!adrs` folders are read, not just preserved.** Point the
  workspace (or an element block) at a folder of markdown and the inspector's
  *Docs* tab shows it for the selected element; *Documentation…* in the menu
  shows the workspace-level set. Elements with docs get a book badge on the
  canvas.
- **Reads what people already have.** Plain Structurizr markdown, adr-tools
  ADRs (`0001-title.md` with `## Status`, supersedes / superseded-by links),
  and [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)
  concepts with frontmatter. Superseded decisions show struck through; links
  between records navigate.
- **Writes OKF.** *New doc* / *New decision* create a frontmatter-bearing
  markdown file (ADRs numbered adr-tools style), update the folder's
  `index.md`, and add the `!docs` / `!adrs` line to the DSL when missing.
  The AI *Draft ADR* feature can save straight into the decisions folder.
- **The assistant is grounded in them.** The deep review, Q&A, interview
  and ADR drafter receive the workspace's documents (ranked by relevance to
  the current view, budgeted), and review findings cite the documents they
  rest on or contradict.
- Needs a folder-backed workspace (File System Access API); single-file mode
  explains why. The markdown renderer is a small built-in subset and never
  executes anything from a file.

## Export

- **PNG** and **SVG** export of the current view, with optional padding control.
- **Standalone interactive HTML** — one `.html` file containing every view of the
  workspace, laid out and rendered as inline SVG, plus a small read-only viewer:
  view tabs, pan and zoom, drill-through, search, and a details panel for any
  element. No network, no dependencies, no c4hero required. The file carries its
  own `Content-Security-Policy` forbidding outside requests, so it renders the
  same in a wiki, in a chat attachment, or from a build artifact years later.
  It also renders the first view with scripts blocked.
- **DSL** export (Save As) writes a clean `.dsl` plus its sidecar JSON.
- **OKF knowledge bundle** — the workspace as an [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)
  bundle: a folder of markdown files with YAML frontmatter, one concept per
  person, system, container, component, deployment node and view, cross-linked
  by bundle-relative path. Built for knowledge bases, search indexes and AI
  assistants rather than for people. Save into a folder (File System Access
  API) or download as a `.zip`. Exporting again into the same folder replaces
  the bundle and removes the concepts that are no longer in the model, so an
  index built from it never serves architecture that has been deleted.
  One-way: the DSL stays the source of truth.
- Exports are deterministic — same workspace, same bytes — so they diff cleanly in pull requests.

## AI assistant (BYOK)

Optional and opt-in. The assistant is inert until you add your own provider key
in AI settings; the key is stored only in this browser and requests go directly
to the provider you choose — c4hero never sees your key or your model data.
Open it from the tool rail, the menu, or the command palette (`AI: …`), or toggle
it with the `I` shortcut.

- **Live model list.** With a key set, the picker shows the models the provider currently offers (filtered to chat-capable ones), cached per key for 24h with a manual refresh. Falls back to curated suggestions without a key or offline; any model id can still be typed. Retired curated defaults resolve to their same-family successor so cheap-draft routing stays valid.
- **Bring your own key** — **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, or **Google Gemini**, with a
  recommended balanced-tier model per provider (and any model you prefer). The
  provider layer is pluggable for adding more.
- **Model health** — an instant, deterministic readout of how complete the model
  is (missing descriptions, technologies, untyped relationships), with
  click-to-fix gaps and a 100% celebration. No AI call required.
- **Improve my model** — one guided flow that combines three things in a single
  stepper: the instant missing-info fixes, an AI **deep review** (orphans, untyped
  links, naming/boundary issues), and an **interview** that asks about anything the
  model can't reveal on its own. The scope lives inside the Improve button (a split
  caret) and grounds the review and questions on the active view or the whole
  model; review of a view leaves another system's elements shown as external
  context alone. Each review fix offers a couple of distinct approaches to pick
  from — or an **Other** box to describe your own, applied through the same edit
  engine. Every change applies the moment you approve it (model health climbs
  live), and a revert ledger undoes any single change — or all of them.
- **Describe a change** — build a new model or edit the current one from a plain-
  English prompt; replacing an existing model always asks first.
- **Inspector assist** — per-field auto-suggestions for empty descriptions and
  technologies, plus tag suggestions constrained to your existing vocabulary.
- **Voice dictation** — speak into assistant inputs where the browser supports the
  Web Speech API.

Every AI-proposed change is shown as a reviewable plan and applied through the
same edit pipeline as manual edits, so it's a single undo entry.

## Accessibility

- ARIA labels on every canvas node and panel.
- Focus-trap on every dialog with focus restoration on close.
- Keyboard shortcuts for every common action; full list in the command palette.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured for canvas animations and the loading skeleton.
- Forced-colors mode is supported.

## Privacy

- No telemetry by default. Hosted deployments can opt in to Cloudflare Web Analytics and Sentry error reporting without sending workspace contents.
- Files stay on your device; nothing is uploaded to a c4hero server. There is no c4hero server.
- See [`PRIVACY.md`](../PRIVACY.md) for the full statement.

## Browser support

Folder collections require the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) — currently only available in Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera). On Firefox and Safari, c4hero automatically falls back to single-file mode; everything else (rendering, editing, export) works identically.
